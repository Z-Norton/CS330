How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
By the end of this project, the planning aspect of my project design had largely solidified once I had gotten more accustomed to the unique graphics workflow. I would clearly outline deliverables and their needed functionality so that my end result matched the requirements

What design process did you follow for your project work?
As this project was extremely visual in nature, my approach to the design process was not standard considering other projects in that I had to think not only like a computer scientist, but a graphic designer, artist, or even architect. The only other comparable workflow that comes to mind is the process of designing a user interface, however, apart from the visual aspects they share, the similarities do not go much further. 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
A trend in software design as I have continued the practice is a gradual increase in the amount of modular code. Not only does this practice allow me to potentially use something I have already written in a future project, but it is something I will continue to apply to make my programs more efficient and readable. 

How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
While by no means a new strategy but one I continue to refine, code formatting and commenting are things that I employed to make it more manageable upon revisiting sections of code later in the development process, as well as when I come back to the project as a whole.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration played a part in the development by means of the milestones. This is to say that the scene was built one feature at a time, starting with the fundamental aspects such as drawing simple shapes and incorporating a camera object, then adding color, texture, camera manipulation, materials, and lighting, all in stages which resulted in having to simply polish the result at the end. 

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My approach to developing code focused on simplicity and efficiency as the scene grew more complicated to avoid running the final project aground with errors.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
As many programs utilize graphical components, from mobile applications to websites, as I refine projects in my capstone my knowledge of rendering 2D and 3D scenes will enhance them. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Developing computer graphics necessitated that I work with and become more familiar with linear algebra. Although I have explored it in the past in isolation, this was the first time practically applying it to another end. As linear algebra is used extensively in many different fields I am relieved to have become more familiar with its use.
